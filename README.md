# GoCommet DevOps Platform

A standardized platform for deploying and managing applications efficiently, securely, and with minimal manual intervention.

 🏗️ Architecture Overview

This platform provides a consistent deployment environment for various application types:
- Internal Dashboards: React + Node.js + PostgreSQL
- CMS Platforms: WordPress + MySQL  
- API Services: Flask + MongoDB
- Collaboration Tools: Wiki systems, Project Management apps

 🚀 Quick Start

# Prerequisites
- Docker & Docker Compose
- Git
- Make (optional, for convenience commands)

# One-Command Deployment
bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/gocomet-devops-platform.git
cd gocomet-devops-platform
make deploy


# Manual Deployment
bash
# Start the platform
docker-compose up -d

# Deploy applications
./scripts/deploy.sh

# Check status
./scripts/status.sh
